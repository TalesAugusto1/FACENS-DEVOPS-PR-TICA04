## **Step-by-Step TDD Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Configuration**

**Step 1: Add JaCoCo Plugin**
- Add JaCoCo plugin to `pom.xml` for code coverage reporting
- Configure the plugin for test coverage

**Step 2: Verify Test Environment**
- Ensure JUnit 5 is working properly
- Run existing tests to confirm setup

### **Phase 2: Domain Model Creation (Stubs)**

**Step 3: Create Student Entity**
- Create `Student` class with basic properties (id, name, active enrollment status)
- Add minimal constructors and getters/setters

**Step 4: Create ForumPost Entity**
- Create `ForumPost` class with properties (id, content, author, likes count)
- Add basic structure

**Step 5: Create Reward System Classes**
- Create `Reward` class (points, student, date)
- Create `Course` class (id, name, required points)
- Create `RewardService` interface and stub implementation

### **Phase 3: Test Implementation (Red Phase)**

**Step 6: Create Test for Scenario 1 - Student Creates Post**
- Test: Student creates forum post → Gets reward points
- Use AAA pattern (Arrange, Action, Assert)
- Test should FAIL initially

**Step 7: Create Test for Scenario 2 - Student Likes Post**
- Test: Student likes forum post → Gets reward points
- Use AAA pattern
- Test should FAIL initially

**Step 8: Create Test for Scenario 3 - Sufficient Points for Course**
- Test: Student has enough points → Gets course access
- Use AAA pattern
- Test should FAIL initially

**Step 9: Create Test for Scenario 4 - Insufficient Points**
- Test: Student doesn't have enough points → Gets notification
- Use AAA pattern
- Test should FAIL initially

### **Phase 4: Validation & Documentation**

**Step 10: Run All Tests**
- Execute all tests to confirm they FAIL
- Document test failures with screenshots
- Generate JaCoCo coverage report (should show 0% coverage)

**Step 11: Document Results**
- Create screenshots of failing tests
- Document the Red phase completion
- Prepare for next phase (Green phase - making tests pass)
